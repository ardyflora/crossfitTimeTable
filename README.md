# crossfitTimeTable
CrossfitTimeTable is written to get the schedule from the crossfit website.

We scrape the data from the crossfit schedule page using Selenium. Once we have
the data, we nicely format it into the table format using prettyTable. Later,
every Monday of the week we text message the schedule to the desired entered number
or we give an option to sync it with your google calendar/icalendar. 

## Task in hand:

- [x] Fetch data from the website
- [ ] Pipe data into prettyTable
- [ ] Text prettyTable data into any Canadian Number
- [ ] Transfer data into icalendar
- [ ] Transfer data into googleCalendar
